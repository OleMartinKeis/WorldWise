# WorldWise

This part of the react course goes through:

-   Creating a Single Page Application (SPA) using React Router
-   CSS modules
-   Storing state in URL
-   Dynamic Routes with URL Parameters
-   Reading and Setting a Query string
-   Nested Routes and Index Routes

As this is just a part of the Course, I will not be creating a new branch and just deploy to the main branch
